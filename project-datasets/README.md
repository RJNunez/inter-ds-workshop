# Project description

This will be an open-ended project in which each group will be assigned a dataset, described below, and they have to turn data into information. It is expected that students apply the material exposed during the week. Specifically, materials presented in __Visualizations with R__ and __Regression Models - Statistical Learning__. For the presentation, each group should follow this structure:

1. __Exploratory data analysis__: Here we expect the students to apply the visualization techniques presented during the week to gain insight on the characteristics of the variables and the relationships between them. 
2. __Formulate a question of interest__: Here we expect the students to formulate a question to be answered with data, a hypothesis. 
3. __Findings and future work__: Here we expect the students to present their findings. This should be a combination of the insights gained from visual inspection and exploratory data analysis plus some form of formal analysis with techniques learned in the regression workshop. 

# Datasets

Four datasets are included here:

1. ___kobe-bryant.csv___
2. ___lebron-james.csv___
3. ___michael-jordan.csv___
4. ___us-mass-shootings.csv___, 

The first three datasets contain information on three of the best players in NBA history: [Kobe Bryant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant), [Lebron James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James), and [Michael Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan). Specifically, each file has the player statistics for each game played. The data comes from the [Basketball-Reference website](https://www.basketball-reference.com). Below you can find a description of the variables.

The last dataset contains information on US Mass shootings of recent history. For each event, the dataset contains demographic information on the shooter, location, fatalities, and others. These data were obtained from the [Mother Jones website](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/). Like the other datasets, you can find a description of the variables below.
